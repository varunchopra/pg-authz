"""
Tests for permission resolution patterns in postkit/authz.

These tests verify correct behavior for complex access patterns:

1. Multi-level hierarchy with alternate paths
2. subject_relation filtering
3. Cascade handling when users join/leave groups
4. Multiple alternate paths to the same permission

With lazy evaluation, permissions are computed at query time via recursive
CTEs. These tests ensure the resolution logic handles edge cases correctly.
